run frontend -> npm run dev
run backend -> php artisans serve

To create a boilerplate for any new react file -> rafce

To work with frontend:
start from src folder , App.jsx is the main file of execution. And other files in their respective folders.

Queries for Pgadmin:
1) sort data in descending order -> SELECT * FROM public.employees
ORDER BY id DESC 

2) to get particular user row from employee table based on email -> SELECT * FROM public.employees where email='khilesh@yopmail.com';

3) to get particular user row from employee table where manager_id is 679 -> SELECT * FROM public.employees where manager_id = 679;

4) to get all data whose employee is not null -> SELECT * FROM public.employees where manager_id is Not null;


To avoid the issue of duplicate index : We just increase the id 
SELECT setval('notifications_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM notifications));


//////////////////////////////// Ticket Page Issue and its solution

[stacktrace]

-- ✅ Step 1: Create a sequence if it doesn't exist
CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS tickets_id_seq;

-- ✅ Step 2: Attach the sequence to the id column so it's auto-incremented
ALTER TABLE tickets ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('tickets_id_seq');
SELECT MAX(id) FROM tickets;
SELECT setval('tickets_id_seq', 51, false);
SELECT setval('tickets_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM tickets));

solution :

SELECT setval('questions_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM questions));

SELECT setval('question_options_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM question_options));
