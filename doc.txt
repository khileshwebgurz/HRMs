run frontend -> npm run dev
run backend -> php artisans serve

To create a boilerplate for any new react file -> rafce

To work with frontend:
start from src folder , App.jsx is the main file of execution. And other files in their respective folders.

Queries for Pgadmin:
1) sort data in descending order -> SELECT * FROM public.employees
ORDER BY id DESC 

2) to get particular user row from employee table based on email -> SELECT * FROM public.employees where email='khilesh@yopmail.com';

3) to get particular user row from employee table where manager_id is 679 -> SELECT * FROM public.employees where manager_id = 679;

4) to get all data whose employee is not null -> SELECT * FROM public.employees where manager_id is Not null;


To avoid the issue of duplicate index : We just increase the id 
SELECT setval('notifications_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM notifications));


//////////////////////////////// Ticket Page Issue and its solution

[previous exception] [object] (PDOException(code: 23502): SQLSTATE[23502]: Not null violation: 7 ERROR:  null value in column \"id\" of relation \"tickets\" violates not-null constraint
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (null, 757, 1, 1, 30 to 60 minutes, dsd, null, 1, 2025-06-23 13:04:39, 2025-06-23 13:04:39). at /home/workspace/Videos/HRMs/server/vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Database/Connection.php:409)
[stacktrace]

-- ✅ Step 1: Create a sequence if it doesn't exist
CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS tickets_id_seq;

-- ✅ Step 2: Attach the sequence to the id column so it's auto-incremented
ALTER TABLE tickets ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('tickets_id_seq');
SELECT MAX(id) FROM tickets;
SELECT setval('tickets_id_seq', 51, false);
SELECT setval('tickets_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM tickets));
